# Weather Forecast-API

# Why APIs Matter?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as bridges between different software systems, enabling them to communicate and share data seamlessly. In this project, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for a given city. This demonstrates how APIs can provide access to a wealth of information, from weather forecasts to financial data and beyond.
